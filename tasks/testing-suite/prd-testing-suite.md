# Product Requirements Document: Testing Suite Implementation

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the implementation of a comprehensive testing suite for the Untitled Game project, a React + TypeScript game using Entity Component System (ECS) architecture with Pixi.js for rendering. The testing suite will focus on game logic validation, ECS interactions, and complete gameplay scenarios while using headless testing with mocked Pixi.js components for performance and reliability.

## Goals

### Primary Objectives

- **Ensure Game Logic Reliability**: Prevent regressions in core ECS systems (movement, pickup, collision detection)
- **Validate ECS Architecture**: Test component interactions, entity management, and system processing
- **Enable Confident Refactoring**: Provide safety net for architectural changes and feature additions
- **Automate Quality Assurance**: Reduce manual testing overhead through comprehensive automated testing
- **Facilitate CI/CD Integration**: Enable automated testing in GitHub Actions for pull request validation

### Business Value

- **Reduced Bug Rate**: Catch issues before they reach production
- **Faster Development**: Developers can refactor and add features with confidence
- **Better Code Quality**: Tests serve as documentation and enforce good practices
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Quick feedback loop during development

## User Stories

### Story 1: Component Testing

**As a** developer  
**I want to** test individual ECS components in isolation  
**So that** I can ensure each component behaves correctly with various inputs

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All component types can be instantiated with valid properties
- [ ] Components reject invalid properties with appropriate errors
- [ ] Component serialization/deserialization works correctly
- [ ] Edge cases (null, undefined, boundary values) are handled properly

### Story 2: System Testing

**As a** developer  
**I want to** test ECS systems independently  
**So that** I can verify system logic without dependencies on other systems

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Each system processes entities correctly according to its logic
- [ ] Systems handle empty entity arrays gracefully
- [ ] Systems properly filter entities based on required components
- [ ] System update methods produce expected state changes

### Story 3: Integration Testing

**As a** developer  
**I want to** test complete ECS workflows  
**So that** I can ensure systems work together correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Player movement system integrates with collision detection
- [ ] Pickup system correctly modifies entity states and inventory
- [ ] Multiple systems can process the same entity without conflicts
- [ ] Entity lifecycle (creation, modification, destruction) works end-to-end

### Story 4: End-to-End Game Scenarios

**As a** developer  
**I want to** test complete gameplay scenarios  
**So that** I can validate the entire game flow from user input to state changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Player can move around the game world
- [ ] Player can pick up items and inventory updates correctly
- [ ] Collision detection prevents invalid movements
- [ ] Game state persists correctly between actions
- [ ] Map editor functionality works as expected

### Story 5: Test Infrastructure

**As a** developer  
**I want** robust testing infrastructure  
**So that** I can write tests efficiently and run them reliably

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Test setup/teardown handles ECS state management
- [ ] Pixi.js components are properly mocked for headless testing
- [ ] Test utilities provide easy entity and component creation
- [ ] Coverage reports show comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Tests run fast enough for frequent execution

## Functional Requirements

### Unit Testing Layer

- **System Tests**: Isolated system behavior verification
- **Utility Function Tests**: Helper function validation (ecsUtils, MappingUtils, etc.)

### Integration Testing Layer

- **System Integration**: Multiple systems working together
- **Entity Lifecycle Tests**: Creation, modification, and cleanup workflows
- **State Management Tests**: Jotai atom interactions with ECS

### End-to-End Testing Layer

- **Gameplay Scenarios**: Complete user interaction flows
- **Map Editor Workflows**: Entity placement and manipulation
- **Cross-System Validation**: Ensure all systems work together correctly

### Test Infrastructure

- **Vitest Configuration**: Optimized for ECS and React testing
- **Mocking Strategy**: Pixi.js components mocked for headless testing
- **Test Utilities**: Helper functions for common test patterns
- **Coverage Reporting**: Comprehensive code coverage analysis

## Non-Goals

### Explicitly Excluded Features

- **Visual Regression Testing**: Pixel-perfect rendering validation (de-prioritized)
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Load testing and performance metrics (future consideration)
- **Browser Compatibility Testing**: Cross-browser validation (not needed for single-target game)
- **Accessibility Testing**: A11y compliance (not applicable for game context)
- **Mobile Testing**: Touch/mobile-specific interactions

## Design Considerations

### Test Organization Structure

```

```

### Testing Patterns

- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure for all tests
- **Factory Pattern**: Standardized entity and component creation for tests
- **Snapshot Testing**: For component and entity state validation
- **Parameterized Tests**: Data-driven testing for multiple scenarios

### Mock Strategy

- **Pixi.js Application**: Mock main application instance
- **Pixi.js Sprites**: Mock sprite creation and manipulation
- **Pixi.js Container**: Mock display object containers
- **DOM Elements**: Mock canvas and other DOM interactions

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements

- **Test Execution Speed**: Complete test suite should run in under 30 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Tests should not exceed 512MB memory usage
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests must be designed to run in parallel safely

### Testing Framework Configuration

- **Vitest**: Primary testing framework (already configured)
- **@testing-library/react**: For React component testing
- **jsdom**: Browser environment simulation
- **Coverage Threshold**: Minimum 80% code coverage for game logic

### Dependency Management

- **Mock Management**: Centralized mock definitions to avoid duplication
- **Test Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies in test environment
- **Version Compatibility**: Ensure test frameworks work with existing toolchain

### CI/CD Integration

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated test execution on PR and main branch
- **Coverage Reporting**: Upload coverage reports to PR comments
- **Test Results**: Clear test failure reporting and debugging information
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution time over time

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Metrics

- **Line Coverage**: ≥80% for game logic modules
- **Branch Coverage**: ≥75% for conditional logic
- **Function Coverage**: ≥90% for public APIs

### Quality Metrics

- **Test Reliability**: <1% flaky test rate
- **Test Execution Time**: Full suite completes in <30 seconds
- **Bug Detection Rate**: Tests catch ≥90% of regressions before production

### Developer Experience Metrics

- **Test Writing Efficiency**: Developers can write new tests in <15 minutes
- **Debugging Support**: Failed tests provide clear error messages and context
- **Maintenance Overhead**: <10% of development time spent maintaining tests

## Open Questions

### Technical Decisions

1. **Playwright Integration**: Should we add Playwright for browser-based E2E testing, or is Vitest sufficient?
2. **Visual Testing**: Do we need any form of visual regression testing for critical UI elements?
3. **Test Data Management**: Should we use fixtures, factories, or inline test data creation?

### Implementation Details

1. **Mocking Granularity**: How detailed should Pixi.js mocks be? Full API coverage or minimal interface?
2. **Async Testing**: How should we handle asynchronous operations in ECS systems?
3. **State Isolation**: What's the best strategy for isolating test state between test runs?

### Process Questions

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Should new features require tests to be written first?
2. **Code Review Process**: Should test coverage be a requirement for PR approval?
3. **Maintenance Strategy**: How often should tests be reviewed and updated?
