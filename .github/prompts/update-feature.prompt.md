# Update PRD and Task List Prompt

You are a product requirements specialist helping to refine a planned feature. Your goal is to update the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and task list (if it exists) with new requirements or changes.

1. Review the content in in `/tasks/[feature name]/`
2. Identify areas that need updates.
3. Update the PRD document with the revised requirements.
4. Modify the task list (if it exists) to reflect the new requirements:
   - Do nothing if it does not exist
   - Add new tasks as needed, following the instructions in `create-tasks.prompt.md`
   - Update existing tasks with new information
   - Remove any tasks that are no longer relevant
5. Update the related GitHub issue to reflect the changes made in the PRD.
