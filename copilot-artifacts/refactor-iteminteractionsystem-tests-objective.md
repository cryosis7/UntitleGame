# Refactor ItemInteractionSystem Tests - Objective and Progress

## Objective

Refactor the `ItemInteractionSystem.test.ts` file to implement the improved testing structure and naming conventions defined in the accompanying documents. This refactoring will move from path-based testing to behavior-focused testing with comprehensive coverage analysis and missing test implementation.

## Requirements and Constraints

1. **Follow ECS Architecture Patterns**: Use utilities from `ComponentOperations.ts`, `MappingUtils.ts`, and `EntityFactory.ts`
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Achieve 100% test coverage on the ItemInteractionSystem unit test file
3. **Behavior-Focused Naming**: Move away from "Path X.Y" naming to descriptive behavior-based test names
4. **Hierarchical Organization**: Implement the testing hierarchy defined in `ItemInteractionSystem-testing-hierarchy.md`
5. **Game Terminology**: Use game-specific language (entities, items, interactions) rather than technical jargon
6. **Self-Documenting Code**: Minimize comments, prefer clear code structure and naming

## Instructions from System Prompts

- At the start of every interaction, state objective in a new document in `copilot-artifacts/` directory ✓
- Add requirements and constraints ✓
- Add every instruction including system prompts ✓
- Create checklist of tasks to complete ✓
- Use checklist to track progress ✓
- Keep log of progress and decisions ✓
- Summarize progress and decisions each time updating document ✓
- Reread document before starting new task ✓
- Follow user coding instructions:
  - Signal user at end of interaction ✓
  - Use BurntToast for 10-word summary notification ✓
  - Use `&&` after terminal commands ✓
  - Use GH CLI for GitHub interactions ✓

## Task Checklist

### Phase 1: Analysis and Coverage Assessment
- [ ] **T001**: Run current tests with coverage to identify gaps
- [ ] **T002**: Analyze existing test structure and map to new hierarchy
- [ ] **T003**: Identify missing test cases based on coverage analysis
- [ ] **T004**: Document current test limitations and technical debt

### Phase 2: Test Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] **T005**: Create improved test fixtures following game terminology
- [ ] **T006**: Set up enhanced test utilities for ECS operations
- [ ] **T007**: Implement reusable entity creation patterns
- [ ] **T008**: Create test data management utilities

### Phase 3: Core Test Structure Migration
- [ ] **T009**: Refactor "Interaction Prerequisites" test group
- [ ] **T010**: Refactor "Item-Target Compatibility" test group
- [ ] **T011**: Refactor "Interaction Positioning" test group
- [ ] **T012**: Refactor "Interaction Outcomes" test group
- [ ] **T013**: Refactor "Item Usage" test group

### Phase 4: Missing Test Implementation
- [ ] **T014**: Implement missing "Complete Interaction Flows" tests
- [ ] **T015**: Implement missing "System Robustness" tests
- [ ] **T016**: Add edge case tests identified in coverage analysis
- [ ] **T017**: Add integration scenario tests

### Phase 5: Validation and Documentation
- [ ] **T018**: Run full test suite with coverage verification
- [ ] **T019**: Update test documentation and examples
- [ ] **T020**: Validate all tests pass and meet quality standards
- [ ] **T021**: Create migration summary and lessons learned

## Dependencies

- T002-T004 depend on T001 (coverage analysis complete)
- T005-T008 can run in parallel after T001-T004
- T009-T013 depend on T005-T008 (infrastructure ready)
- T014-T017 depend on T009-T013 (core structure migrated)
- T018-T021 depend on all previous tasks (validation phase)

## Progress Log

**Initial Setup (Completed)**:
- ✅ Created objective document
- ✅ Analyzed requirements from attached files
- ✅ Identified key refactoring areas
- ✅ Created comprehensive task breakdown
- ✅ Generated detailed 14-task implementation plan
- ✅ Structured tasks with dependencies and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Organized tasks into logical phases from analysis to validation

**Task Creation Summary**:
- Created comprehensive task list with 16-20 hour estimate
- Organized into 5 categories: Analysis, Infrastructure, Migration, Implementation, Validation
- Identified critical dependency chain ensuring proper implementation order
- Included coverage analysis as prerequisite for missing test identification
- Structured tasks to achieve 100% test coverage requirement

## Current Status
✅ Task List Creation Complete - Ready for execution starting with T001

## Next Steps
1. Execute T001: Run coverage analysis on current ItemInteractionSystem tests
2. Begin systematic task execution following dependency chain
3. Track progress against behavior-focused testing objectives
